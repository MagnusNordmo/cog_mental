# cog_mental
This repository contains the R script for the paper "Cognitive Abilities and Educational Attainment as Antecedents of Mental Disorders" by Nordmo et al. (2024)

The repository is organized into several folders, each containing specific types of files:

- data: This folder contains .csv files with summary statistics from the original data source, the Norwegian registers. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, only summary statistics are included. These .csv files can be used to construct the plots found in the manuscript.
- plots: This folder contains the R scripts used to generate the plots included in the manuscript.
- models: This folder contains the R scripts used to model the data. Since the original data cannot be uploaded, this folder includes scripts to generate simulated data using means and covariances. It also contains the code used to generate the supplemental material.
- prepare_data: This folder includes the R scripts that were used to create the original data from disparate registers. These scripts are only useful for researchers working with these specific registers with their unique setups.

For questions, please refer to the paper or contact the authors.
